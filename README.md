# **Festival of Insights: Diwali Sales Analysis with Python to Brighten Business Strategies**

## **Project Objective:**
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diwali Sales dataset using Python. Through EDA, we will explore the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights that can help improve business decisions during the Diwali sales period. This project serves as a practical example of how EDA is applied to real-world data for deeper understanding and analysis.
